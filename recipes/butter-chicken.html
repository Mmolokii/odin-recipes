            Butter chicken, also known as Murgh Makhani, is a popular Indian dish made with tender 
            <br>chicken pieces cooked in a rich, creamy tomato-based sauce. The chicken is first marinated 
            <br>in a blend of yogurt and spices, including ginger, garlic, turmeric, garam masala, and chili 
            <br>powder. After marinating, the chicken is grilled or pan-fried until lightly charred, then 
            <br>simmered in a luscious sauce made from tomatoes, cream, butter, and aromatic spices 
            <br>such as cumin, coriander, and fenugreek. The result is a flavorful and indulgent dish that's 
            <br>perfect when served with naan or basmati rice.</p>

                <li>1 cup half-and-half</li>
                <li>¼ cup plain yogurt</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Sauté shallot and onion until soft 
                    <br>and translucent, about 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in butter, ginger-garlic paste, lemon juice, 1 teaspoon garam masala, chili powder, cumin, 
                    <br>and bay leaf. Cook and stir for 1 minute. Add tomato sauce, and cook for 2 minutes, continuing to 
                    <br>frequently stir.
                </li>
                <li>Stir in half-and-half and yogurt. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for 10 minutes, frequently stirring. 
                    <br>Season with salt and pepper. Remove from heat and set aside.
                </li>
                <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken until 
                    <br>lightly browned, about 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>Reduce heat, and season with remaining 1 teaspoon garam masala and cayenne. Stir in a few 
                    <br>spoonfuls of sauce, and simmer until liquid has reduced, and chicken is no longer pink. Add cooked 
                    <br>chicken into sauce and stir together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Dissolve cornstarch into water, then mix into the sauce. Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, or until thickened.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve over rice with naan.
                </li>
