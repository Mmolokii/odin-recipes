        <h1>Pizza Recipe</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/91/Pizza-3007395.jpg" alt="Sliced Pizza" width="300" height="300">
        <p>A traditional pizza recipe features a thin, crispy crust topped with a flavorful tomato sauce, 
            <br>a generous layer of mozzarella cheese, and a variety of classic toppings. The dough is 
            <br>made from flour, water, yeast, salt, and olive oil, kneaded until smooth, then allowed to 
            <br>rise until it doubles in size. The tomato sauce, made from ripe tomatoes, garlic, olive oil, 
            <br>and Italian herbs like oregano and basil, is spread evenly over the rolled-out dough. The 
            <br>pizza is then topped with fresh mozzarella cheese and traditional ingredients such as 
            <br>pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, and olives. Baked in a hot oven until the 
            <br>crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned, this classic pizza is a 
            <br>delicious, crowd-pleasing dish that embodies the simplicity and flavors of Italian cuisine.</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Toppings</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>6 ounces low moisture mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>½ cup no salt added canned crushed tomatoes</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
                <li>6 leaves fresh basil, torn</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Make the dough: Pour warm water into a large bowl, then sprinkle yeast over the
                    <br>top. Let stand for 5 minutes. Stir in cold water and salt. Stir in flour, 1 cup at a
                    <br>time until incorporated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Knead dough on a floured surface until smooth, about 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Divide in half and form into two tight dough balls. Coat with olive oil and
                    <br>refrigerate in a sealed container for at least 16 hours. Be sure to use a big enough
                    <br>container to allow dough to rise.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Make the pizzas: Remove dough from the refrigerator one hour prior to using.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat the oven, with a pizza stone on the lowest rack, to 550 degrees F (288
                    <br>degrees C). Lightly dust a pizza peel with flour.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prepare the first pizza: Lightly dust one dough ball with flour and stretch
                    <br>gradually until about 14 inches in diameter, or about the size of the pizza stone.
                    <br>Place on the floured peel.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lay 1/2 of the mozzarella on the crust, then sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon oregano and
                    <br>1/8 teaspoon pepper over the top. Randomly arrange 1/4 cup crushed tomatoes
                    <br>over the pizza, leaving some empty areas, then drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil
                    <br>over top.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With a quick back and forth jerk, make sure dough will release from the peel
                    <br>easily. Place the tip of the peel at the back of the preheated pizza stone, and
                    <br>remove the peel so that the pizza is left on the stone.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until the crust begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Slide the pizza onto the peel and remove from the oven; then slide off the peel
                    <br>onto a work surface. Sprinkle 1/2 of the basil leaves randomly over the pizza. Cut
                    <br>into wedges and serve.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Follow Steps 5 through 9 to make the second pizza.
                </li>
